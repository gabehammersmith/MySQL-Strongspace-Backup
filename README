A simple bash script I created to backup MySQL databases to Strongspace. 
It makes use of Keychain so that a passphrase protected key may be used in 
automated backups.

mysql_backup.sh uses rsync's --delete-after flag. If you don't know what that 
means, you should read the rsync man page before attempting to use this script.

I run it from CRON. Daily backups are stored for two weeks. On the first of 
every month, the backup is archived and stored for one year. If mysqldump fails,
an e-mail is sent. The same happens if rsync fails.
